Optimole is the all-in-one solution to all of your image optimization needs. With full automation and a range of evolutionary features, Optimole makes it easy to clean up your heavy images and bloaty pages.

Optimole optimizes your images in real-time with a cloud-based system to speed up your website and deliver high-quality images perfectly sized for every device. With a one-click setup and minimal footprint, you can start improving your site in minutes.

You'll be free to concentrate on other aspects of your site with Optimole's set and forget image optimization.

So, if you have been looking for one plugin that provides lazy loading with a CDN and perfectly sized images, then Optimole is perfect for you.


**How does it do all these great things?**
Optimole's format based optimization is handled in the cloud on a case-by-case basis. Once you have the plugin installed, Optimole will replace all of your image URLs with cloud-based URLs. We don't replace any images on your website.
When the image is requested, Optimole will apply the specific transformations required by the device and deliver it to your visitors. This means every image is perfectly sized for every device. The final result will be cached for a month to ensure ongoing fast delivery and more site speed.

**How many images can be optimized?**
With the basic plan, you will be able to optimize 1GB of images per month with 5GB viewing bandwidth. All delivered from 7 edge locations all over the world.
Better yet. The free version is fully functional and includes all of the following great features.

**Format Based Optimization**
Our cloud-based transformation process means we can offer optimizations based on the format. If your visitor is using a WebP capable browser, then Optimole will send a WebP image to their device.

**Image Optimization**
Our algorithms crunch the numbers to provide the best lossy or lossless optimization for the best-looking image at the smallest size.

**Exact Used Size**
Optimole will use just one image and resize it to fit perfectly on your visitors' devices. No more awkward guesses at potential screen widths.

**Retina Support**
Optimole can detect Retina screens and deliver an image with the perfect Digital Pixel Ratio (DPR).

**Smart Cropping**
If you'd like to keep the most interesting part of an image; then you can enable smart cropping to help keep the image well sized without losing focus.

**No Content Shifting**
The lazy load option is perfectly sized for the container to provide a seamless viewing experience without any content shifting.

**Watermarks**
Who has time for adding watermarks? Optimole will do the hard work for you. Just set it up and pick your preferred location and Optimole will add the watermark to all of your future images.

**Downgrade Quality For Slower Connections**
Optimole provides an option to downgrade the image quality when it detects a slower network. Make the images up to 40% smaller with this neat feature to help visitors in a bottleneck.
**Compatibility**
Optimole loves page builders and has unique tweaks to solve image replacements. It also has full compatibility with the new block editor in WordPress 5.0

**CDN**
Optimole provides free access to a CDN with 7 edge locations around the world. Even more with the Pro version.

**What About Security?**
The stripped EXGIF data is not stored on our service. Optimole likes to work behind the scenes, and won't interact with your site's visitors. No data is collected but you can check the [Terms of Service](https://optimole.com/terms/)

**Smooth And Clean**
Optimole can be installed in a few clicks and then left in the back-end to do its job. Not happy with it? Optimole has a clean uninstall and your site will be just as before Optimole was installed.

**Go Pro**
Premium users will be able to optimize 10GB images per month with a 50GB viewing bandwidth. Images in the Premium plan are served from AWS Cloudfront with over 130 locations.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### How many images I can optimize with each plan? ###

The number of images that you can optimize depends on your original image size and the number of transformations you do for it.  Using the Free plan you can optimize up to 1 GB of images, which means around 2000 images at an average of 500Kb per image.

### What happens if I exceed plan limits? ###

Once you exceed these, we will contact you and kindly ask to upgrade to the plan that fits you best.

### What Content Delivery Network (CDN) do you use? ###

Our FREE plan uses our custom made CDN built with 7 locations around the globe. For the paid plans, we have direct integration with Amazon Cloudfront, with more than 130 locations around the globe.

### I'm already using a CDN, can I use that instead of yours ? ###

Short answer, YES. We can help you integrate your default CDN but it will require some additional work from our side and is available to Enterprise plans.

### I'm already using an image optimization plugin, why should I switch to OptiMole? ###

You donâ€™t need to change your existing optimization plugin, image optimization is just a small part of what we do, if you are happy with ShortPixel for e.g, feel free to continue to use it, OptiMole would then take care only of serving your image at the RIGHT size, advanced cropping and smart lazy-loading.

### Does Optimole handle images from Ajax content  ? ###

Yes, we do. By default, Optimole handle images delivered from your ajax content from admin-ajax.php ( not logged in users ) as well as WordPress REST API routes.

### Can i remove the blurry placeholder from the lazyload effct ? ###

Yes, you can. We have bundled this tweak into a plugin you can install while you have Optimole active. The blurry placeholder will be removed and the images will be still lazy-loaded. You can find the plugin tweak here -> http://bit.ly/optml-rm-lqip

### Will the original images be deleted? ###

Absolutely No. We use your original images as sources when deliver the optimized images.

### What is the difference between the Auto, High, Medium, Low compression levels? ###

A higher compression might result in a small loss of image quality. Selecting the auto level will let Optimole choose the minimum size with no loss in the quality of your picture.

### I used Kraken, Shortpixel, Optimus, EWWW or WP Smush, Imagify  will OptiMole further optimize my images? ###

 Yes, Optimole will also take care of serving your image at the RIGHT size for your visitors and optimize them to the best possible format for their browser.

### Which formats can be optimized ? ###

For now we support jpg, png and svg format.

### Does Optimole automatically serve WebP for Chrome users ? ###

Yes. We automatically detect user browser and serve WebP if is supported, otherwise we optimize the image in the original format.

### Can I disable lazyload for PNG images ? ###

Yes. You need to add `define("OPTML_DISABLE_PNG_LAZYLOAD",true);` to `your wp-config.php` file.

### Can I disable optimization for a certain image ? ###

Yes, you can follow this code snippet and replace the sample image with the one you need:
<code>
add_filter('optml_dont_replace_url', function( $old, $url ) {
	if ( $url === 'https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.jpg' ) {
		return true;
	}
	return $old;

}, 10, 2);
</code>
