### What’s the Magic Behind Optimole’s Image Optimization?

Optimole handles image optimization seamlessly in the cloud—tailored to each visitor in real time. Once installed, it automatically replaces your image URLs with cloud-based ones, without altering the original files on your server.

When someone visits your site, Optimole instantly **detects their device type, screen size, browser, and connection speed**. Based on this data, it delivers the **ideal version** of each image—perfectly resized, compressed, and converted into the most efficient format their browser supports.

### How Many Images Can Be Optimized? (Unlimited)

We offer an unlimited number of image optimizations in both Free and Pro plans, you will be able to optimize an unlimited number of images for up to 1K [monthly visits](https://docs.optimole.com/article/1134-how-optimole-counts-the-number-of-visitors). All are delivered from more than **450+ locations** around the globe.

### Features That Make Optimole The Ultimate Image Solution:

#### 🔄 Seamless Bulk Optimization

Optimize your entire media library with a single click. Optimole processes your images in the background, so you don't need to keep your browser open during optimization. Perfect for existing websites with large image collections.

#### 🚀 One-Click Image Offloading

Free up valuable server space by offloading your entire media library to Optimole's secure cloud storage. All your images are safely stored and delivered from our optimized CDN, reducing your hosting costs and server load. Need your images back on your server? Our seamless one-click restoration process makes it easy to transfer everything back 
whenever you want, giving you complete flexibility and control over your media assets.

#### 🌎 CDN

Optimole provides free access to an AWS CloudFront CDN with edge locations in more than 450+ cities around the globe.

#### 🖼️ ML-Powered Smart Compression

Our machine learning algorithms analyze each image to determine the optimal compression level that balances quality and file size. Unlike basic compression tools, Optimole's smart compression adapts to image content, preserving important details while aggressively compressing areas where quality loss won't be noticeable. Making it easy to compress images without sacrificing quality.

#### 🔄 Intelligent Format-Based Optimization

Our advanced cloud-based transformation process optimizes images based on format and serves them in next-gen formats automatically. If your visitor's browser supports WebP or AVIF, Optimole instantly converts and delivers these formats, reducing file size by up to 80% compared to traditional JPEG and PNG, while maintaining visual quality.

#### 💾 Advanced Digital Asset Management (DAM)

Take complete control of your media with our built-in DAM system. Store images in the Optimole Cloud to save server space and easily share assets between multiple websites. Our seamless integration with Elementor Builder and WordPress core editor means you can access your optimized cloud images directly from your familiar editing interfaces.

#### 📏 Exact Responsive Sizing

Optimole delivers just one image perfectly sized for each visitor's exact device dimensions - no more generating multiple image sizes or guessing at breakpoints. This means mobile users don't download desktop-sized images, and desktop users get appropriately high-resolution versions.

#### 📱 Retina & High-DPR Display Support

Automatically detect high-resolution displays like Retina screens and deliver images with the perfect Device Pixel Ratio (DPR). Your images will look crisp and sharp on the latest devices without unnecessarily large file sizes on standard displays.

#### ⚡ No Content Shifting with Advanced Lazy Loading

Our lightweight lazy loading defers offscreen images for faster initial page loads without any content shifting. Optimole's implementation doesn't rely on heavy jQuery dependencies, making it faster than other lazy loading solutions while being more compatible with modern themes.

#### 🔍 AI-Powered Smart Cropping

Maintain focus on the important elements in your images with our intelligent cropping system. Whether it's faces in portraits, products in e-commerce shots, or key elements in landscapes, smart cropping ensures proper sizing without losing the subject's focus. This is especially valuable for responsive designs where image dimensions change dramatically.

#### 💧 Customizable Watermarking

Protect your images with automatic watermarking. Configure your watermark once, select positioning and opacity, and Optimole will apply it to all future uploads automatically. Perfect for photographers, artists, and content creators who need to protect their work.

#### 🖼️ Multiple File Type Support 

Optimole goes beyond just images. Our cloud dashboard supports uploading and managing a wide variety of file types, including videos, audio files, PDFs, documents, and more. This makes Optimole a comprehensive media management solution, not just an image optimizer. Store all your media assets in one place, organize them efficiently, and access them across all your websites with our cloud library system.
