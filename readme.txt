End-to-end image processing
With OptiMole, your siteâ€™s images will be cropped, optimized and processed on-the-fly.


== Description ==
**Image optimization & resizing**
Images are processed for best results with both lossless and lossy optimization and are automatically resized for any device.

**Image acceleration through CDN**
If you dont use a CDN, we got you covered, we will serve the images using our default CDN. You already have one, just let us know and we can integrate yours.

**On-the-fly image handling**
Dynamic manipulation of images and videos (resize, compress and serve via CDN on the fly).

**Easy tracking & monitoring**
Check how OptiMole is improving your site from day 1. Transparent optimization stats are always available.

= How does it work? =

This plugin connects via API to OptiMole [image optimization service](https://optimole.com/) in order to send the images to its servers and crop, optimize and process them on-the-fly. The EXIF data will either be stripped and it is not stored on our servers. Optimole does not interact with the visitors on your website. We care about your privacy so check our [terms of use](https://optimole.com/terms/).

The plugin will rewrite your image URLs to replace them with OptiMole URLs. Your origin images will be downloaded from your storage, processed by the OptiMole infrastructure and cached in the CDN. NO development needed. Simply set up your account and enjoy faster image loading.
