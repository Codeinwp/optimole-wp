### How does it do all these great things?

Optimole's format-based optimization is handled in the cloud on a case-by-case basis. Once you have the plugin installed, Optimole will replace all of your image URLs with cloud-based URLs. We don't replace any images on your website, we compress images on the fly.

When the image is requested, Optimole will apply the specific transformations required by the device and deliver it to your visitors. This means every image is perfectly sized for every device. The final result will be cached for a month to ensure ongoing fast delivery and more site speed.

### How many images can be optimized?

With the basic plan, you will be able to optimize an unmetered number of images for up to 1k monthly [visits](https://docs.optimole.com/article/1134-how-optimole-counts-the-number-of-visitors). All are delivered from more than 450+ locations around the globe.
