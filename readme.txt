So, if you have been looking for one plugin that provides lazy loading with a CDN and perfectly sized images, then Optimole is perfect for you.


**How does it do all these great things?**
Optimole's format based optimization is handled in the cloud on a case-by-case basis. Once you have the plugin installed, Optimole will replace all of your image URLs with cloud-based URLs. We don't replace any images on your website, we compress images on the fly.
When the image is requested, Optimole will apply the specific transformations required by the device and deliver it to your visitors. This means every image is perfectly sized for every device. The final result will be cached for a month to ensure ongoing fast delivery and more site speed.

**How many images can be optimized?**
With the basic plan, you will be able to optimize unmetered number of images for up to 5k monthly [visits](https://docs.optimole.com/article/1134-how-optimole-counts-the-number-of-visitors). All delivered from more than 200+ locations around the globe.
Better yet. The free version is fully functional and includes all of the following great features:

**Format Based Optimization**
Our cloud-based transformation process means we can optimize images based on the format as well as serve images in next-gen formats. If your visitor is using a WebP capable browser, then Optimole will convert to WebP the image and send it to their device. AVIF support included.

**Cloud Library support**
Offload your website images directly to Optimole Cloud and save storage space on your server. Cross share images between your all your websites connected to Optimole.

**Image Optimization**
Our algorithms crunch the numbers to provide the best lossy or lossless optimization for the best-looking image at the smallest size using Machine Learning(ML) powered compression.

**Exact Used Size**
Optimole will use just one image and resize it delivering a responsive image to fit perfectly on your visitors' devices. No more awkward guesses at potential screen widths. Serve scaled images instantly.

**Retina Support**
Optimole can detect Retina screens and deliver an image with the perfect Digital Pixel Ratio (DPR).

**Smart Cropping**
If you'd like to keep the most interesting part of an image; then you can enable smart cropping to help keep the image well sized without losing focus.

**No Content Shifting**
The lazy load option defer offscreen images and is perfectly sized for the container to provide a seamless viewing experience without any content shifting.

**Watermarks**
Who has time for adding watermarks? Optimole will do the hard work for you. Just set it up and pick your preferred location and Optimole will add the watermark to all of your future images.

**Downgrade Quality For Slower Connections**
Optimole provides an option to downgrade the image quality when it detects a slower network. Efficiently encode images by making up to 40% smaller with this neat feature to help visitors in a bottleneck.

**Compatibility**
Optimole loves page builders and has unique tweaks to solve image replacements. It also has full compatibility with the new block editor since WordPress 5.0

**CDN**
Optimole provides free access to a AWS CloudFront CDN with edge locations in more than 200 cities around the globe.

**What About Security?**
The stripped EXGIF data is not stored on our service. Optimole likes to work behind the scenes, and won't interact with your site's visitors. No data is collected but you can check the [Terms of Service](https://optimole.com/terms/)

**Smooth And Clean**
Optimole can be installed in a few clicks and then left in the back-end to do its job. Not happy with it? Optimole has a clean uninstall and your site will be just as before Optimole was installed.

**Go Pro**
Premium users will be able to optimize images starting with more than 25k monthly active users. Images in the Premium plan are served from AWS Cloudfront with over 200 locations all over the world.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many images I can optimize with each plan? =

The number of images that you can optimize or store is unlimited, we care only about the number of visits you have per month.

= What happens if I exceed plan limits? =

Once you exceed these, we will contact you and kindly ask to upgrade to the plan that fits you best.

= What Content Delivery Network (CDN) do you use? =

For both FREE and Paid plans we use AWS CloudFront CDN with more than 200 locations around the globe.

= I'm already using a CDN, can I use that instead of yours ? =

Short answer, YES. You will only need to whitelist the domain of your existing CDN for Optimole to pick images stored there.

= I'm already using an image optimization plugin, why should I switch to Optimole? =

You donâ€™t need to change your existing optimization plugin, image optimization is just a small part of what we do, if you are happy with ShortPixel for e.g, feel free to continue to use it, Optimole would then take care only of serving your image at the RIGHT size, advanced cropping and smart lazy-loading.

= Does Optimole handle images from Ajax content  ? =

Yes, we do. By default, Optimole handle images delivered from your ajax content from admin-ajax.php ( not logged in users ) as well as WordPress REST API routes.

= Can I remove the blurry placeholder from the lazyload effect ? =

Yes, you can. You only need to toggle this feature in the plugin as explained per this doc - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1020-can-i-remove-the-blurry-placeholder-from-the-lazyload-effct

= Will the original images be deleted? =

We use your original images as sources when deliver the optimized images. Unless you want to remove images from your server to save some space with Cloud Library by offloading images to the cloud as explained here - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1323-cloud-library-browsing

= What is the difference between the Auto, High, Medium, Low compression levels? =

A higher compression might result in a small loss of image quality. Selecting the auto level will let Optimole choose the minimum size with no loss in the quality of your picture.

= I used Kraken, Shortpixel, Optimus, EWWW or WP Smush, Imagify  will Optimole further optimize my images? =

Yes, Optimole will also take care of serving your image at the RIGHT size for your visitors and optimize them to the best possible format for their browser.

= Which formats can be optimized ? =

For now we support jpg, png and svg format.

= Does Optimole automatically serve WebP for Chrome users ? =

Yes. We automatically detect user browser and serve WebP if is supported, otherwise we optimize the image in the original format.

= Can I disable lazyload for PNG images ? =

Yes. You need to add `define("OPTML_DISABLE_PNG_LAZYLOAD",true);` to `your wp-config.php` file.

You can also use plugin's UI and exclude images by their type as explained here - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1191-exclude-from-optimizing-or-lazy-loading

= Can I disable optimization for a certain image ? =

Yes, you can exclude certain image by its name as explained here - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1191-exclude-from-optimizing-or-lazy-loading

In case you're tech-savvy and want programatically exclude images by some conditions you can follow this code snippet and replace the sample image with the one you need or have other conditions:

<code>
add_filter('optml_dont_replace_url', function( $old, $url ) {
	if ( $url === 'https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.jpg' ) {
		return true;
	}
	return $old;

}, 10, 2);
</code>
