When the image is requested, Optimole will apply the specific transformations required by the device and deliver it to your visitors. This means every image is perfectly sized for every device. The final result will be cached for a month to ensure ongoing fast delivery and more site speed.

### How many images can be optimized?

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How many images I can optimize with each plan? =

The number of images that you can optimize or store is unlimited, we care only about the number of visits you have per month.

= What happens if I exceed plan limits? =

Once you exceed these, we will contact you and kindly ask to upgrade to the plan that fits you best.

= What Content Delivery Network (CDN) do you use? =

For both FREE and Paid plans we use AWS CloudFront CDN with more than 200 locations around the globe.

= I'm already using a CDN, can I use that instead of yours ? =

Short answer, YES. You will only need to whitelist the domain of your existing CDN for Optimole to pick images stored there.

= I'm already using an image optimization plugin, why should I switch to Optimole? =

You don’t need to change your existing optimization plugin, image optimization is just a small part of what we do, if you are happy with ShortPixel for e.g, feel free to continue to use it, Optimole would then take care only of serving your image at the RIGHT size, advanced cropping and smart lazy-loading.

= Does Optimole handle images from Ajax content  ? =

Yes, we do. By default, Optimole handle images delivered from your ajax content from admin-ajax.php ( not logged in users ) as well as WordPress REST API routes.

= Can I remove the blurry placeholder from the lazyload effect ? =

Yes, you can. You only need to toggle this feature in the plugin as explained per this doc - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1020-can-i-remove-the-blurry-placeholder-from-the-lazyload-effct

= Will the original images be deleted? =

We use your original images as sources when deliver the optimized images. Unless you want to remove images from your server to save some space with Cloud Library by offloading images to the cloud as explained here - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1323-cloud-library-browsing

= What is the difference between the Auto, High, Medium, Low compression levels? =

A higher compression might result in a small loss of image quality. Selecting the auto level will let Optimole choose the minimum size with no loss in the quality of your picture.

= I used Kraken, Shortpixel, Optimus, EWWW or WP Smush, Imagify  will Optimole further optimize my images? =

Yes, Optimole will also take care of serving your image at the RIGHT size for your visitors and optimize them to the best possible format for their browser.

= Which formats can be optimized ? =

For now we support jpg, png and svg format.

= Does Optimole automatically serve WebP for Chrome users ? =

Yes. We automatically detect user browser and serve WebP if is supported, otherwise we optimize the image in the original format.

= Can I disable lazyload for PNG images ? =

Yes. You need to add `define("OPTML_DISABLE_PNG_LAZYLOAD",true);` to `your wp-config.php` file.

You can also use plugin's UI and exclude images by their type as explained here - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1191-exclude-from-optimizing-or-lazy-loading

= Can I disable optimization for a certain image ? =

Yes, you can exclude certain image by its name as explained here - https://docs.optimole.com/article/1191-exclude-from-optimizing-or-lazy-loading

In case you're tech-savvy and want programatically exclude images by some conditions you can follow this code snippet and replace the sample image with the one you need or have other conditions:

<code>
add_filter('optml_dont_replace_url', function( $old, $url ) {
	if ( $url === 'https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.jpg' ) {
		return true;
	}
	return $old;

}, 10, 2);
</code>
